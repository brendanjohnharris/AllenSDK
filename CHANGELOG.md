## [2.3.3] = 2020-11-12
### Bug Fixes
- (Internal) Fixed a bug in mesoscope processing where the ophys acquisition frames were being truncated
prior to splitting, resulting in many fewer than expected acquisition frames.

## [2.3.2] = 2020-10-19

### Bug Fixes
- (Internal) Fixed a running\_processing bug for behavior ophys experiments when the input data would have one more encoder entry than timestamp. The behavior of the code now matches what the warning says.

## [2.3.1] = 2020-10-13

### Bug Fixes
- (Internal) Fixed a write\_nwb bug for behavior ophys experiments involving the BehaviorOphysJsonApi expecting a mesoscope-specific method.

## [2.3.0] = 2020-10-09

### Added
- Adds load sync data for individual plane sets to relate accurate event timings to mesoscope data.
- Adds public API method to access the behavior\_session\_id from an instance of BehaviorOphysSession.

### Changes
- Visual behavior running speed is now low-pass filtered at 10Hz. The raw running speed data is still available. The running speed is corrected for encoder threshold croissing artifacts.
- Support for stimulus gratings for visual behavior.
- Updates to some visual behavior pynwb implementations.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed an eye-tracking sync problem.

## [2.2.0] = 2020-09-03

### Added
- AllenSDK HTTP engine streaming requests now include a progress bar.

### Changed
- (Internal) Behavior Ophys Sessions no longer have a dependence on the `segmentation_mask_image` file (provided by LIMS) when trying to write NWB files.

### Bug Fixes
- (Internal) `response_time` of a trial in behavior-only or behavior + ophys sessions is now the first lick of the trial (for non-"aborted" trials). If no lick occurred or if the trial is "aborted", `response_time` is `NaN`.
- Resolve `ImportError: cannot import name 'MultiContainerInterface' from 'hdmf.container'` errors by removing explicit version bounds on the `hdmf` package.
- The optical physiology 2-photon trace demixer has been modified to be more memory friendly and should no longer result in out of memory errors when trying to demix very large movie stacks.
- (Internal) Docker image definitions have been updated so that internal continuous integration tests can work properly

## [2.1.0] = 2020-07-16

### Added
- Behavior Ophys NWB File writing capability fixes for updated PyNWB and HDMF versions
- Added warning if using outdated Visual Coding Neuropixels NWB files

## [2.0.0] = 2020-06-11

### Added
- CCF locations for ecephys neuropixels electrodes have been added to their respective nwb electrodes tables
- Examples for accessing eye tracking ellipse fit and screen gaze location data have been added to ecephys example notebooks

### Changed
- pynwb and hdmf version pinning has been relaxed
- The organization of data for ecephys neuropixels Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) files has been significantly changed to conform with NWB specifications and best practices

**Important Note**:
Due to newer versions of pynwb/hdmf having issues reading previously released Visual Coding Neuropixels NWB files and due to the significant reorganization of their NWB file contents, this release contains breaking changes that necessitate a major version revision. NWB files released prior to 6/11/2020 are not guaranteed to work with the 2.0.0 version of AllenSDK. If you cannot or choose not to re-download the updated NWB files, you can continue using a prior version of AllenSDK (< 2.0.0) to access them. However, no further features or bugfixes for AllenSDK (< 2.0.0) are planned. Data released for other projects (Cell Types, Mouse Connectivity, etc.) are *NOT* affected and will *NOT* need to be re-downloaded

## [1.8.0] = 2020-06-06

### Added

on a rising edge. We are no longer providing a default delay value in case of error.

### Bug Fixes
- experiment\_table from behavior project cache has NaNs in the 'imaging\_depth' column for MultiScope experiments due to incorrect join in behavior\_project\_lims\_api.py and 4 other places where ophys\_sessions was incorrectly queried for imaging\_depth\_id
- get_keys method for sync datasets was returning the wrong line labels and creating incorrect key, value pairs for
data loading from sync files

## [1.6.0] = 2020-03-23

### Added
